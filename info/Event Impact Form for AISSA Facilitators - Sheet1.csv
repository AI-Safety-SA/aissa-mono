Friday: 6 ppl
Saturday: 5 ppl
Sunday: 4 ppl

Lots  of registrations happened on the day of or the night of, people were calling friends and such

I set the event for 8pm (Friday) on luma and got here at 7pm to setup. 
At 7:01 the first person got here and most of the people were here before 7:30. 

We chilled at the AI safety desk there was some confusion on my part about what desks people were allowed to sit at and which chairs they were allowed to use. Also friends wanted to sit next to each other and there's only really space for 3 people max on either side of the desk. Everyone got in through security I didn't have to manually let anyone in. I put a roll of stickers downstairs for people to write their names on but security seemed to give them generic innovation city stickers which was annoying. So we probably need to print actual name tags and then have people wear them with a lanyard. 

I didn't really know what to do as people were coming in I think in hindsight it would have been better to not even come up here because there's nothing to really work on until the keynote and after the keynote we go home. So I think I would put same games and books in the cafe downstairs while people dribble in. By the end of the hackathon I really liked everyone as we got to know each other. In hindsight I think It would have been beneficial to make the time before the keynote mandatory getting to know each other time and playing games and stuff. Especially because the people with friends kind of just stick together and it makes everyone else feel awkward. So ya I would say no working or hacking on friday mandatory social time in the cafeteria before the keynote, then keynote. 

After that I think we should help facilitate teams if none are already formed. Everyone kind of formed one team and I'm not sure that was a good idea. Also it was clear that the people in the team didn't have specific responsibilities so everyone was trying to direct the project which lead to conflict later on. It would be good to formalize what people are in what times, and what their jobs are on friday and what help they need, e.g do they need help programming or writing and what can we provide. I think some of them probably need a laptop to work with so it would be good to have a few dev machines for people that can't normally afford them. E.g one person's wifi card was so old they weren't able to connect to the internet. Also having pre setup hackathon machines would make helping people with coding a lot easier, we could setup cursor, pnpm, python in a way that makes sense and allows people to collaborate more easily. Especially if they're logged into a shared GitHub account or had we had a server to share files and text with during the hackathon. 

Oh the wifi password is impossible to share. We need a QR code for connecting to it as people come in. 

Everyone should join a WhatsApp group on the Friday or discord or something to make sharing stuff like pictures or code or logistic easy. Could potentially be luma chat but most people didn't seem to know what luma was.  

I bought some snacks on Friday, I forgot to buy drinks which was annoying or ice also my food taste is weird, I'm a vegetarian it would be good to have a standard list of snacks that most people like maybe even just ordering it from an actual caterer or something. Also I didn't know if we could get snacks each day or not I still had budget from friday so I got more on saturday but if I didn't wouldn't have known what to do. 

People seemed unclear on when they could come to innovation city, like did they have to come the whole day every day or just one day or just one hour. Someone on discord had this question but also people at the event seemed to not know when it ended each day. 

I wanted to do a project and started working on a project on saturday but I found I basically couldn't do anything productive because  I wanted to be open and available for people to ask questions about stuff but also it was noisy and at times people were playing music and taking calls and other such things. So 1. I think the host probably shouldn't participate in the hackathon or there should be at least one person whose only job is to be there to host and help people and answer questions. Feeling like you need to hack-athon and host is just stressful and I think are in conflict with being a good host. Which is the primary thing. If you have co hosts this might be possible to participate but, there should be one person who is just there and has an open energy for people to feel comfortable with walking up to them.

In terms of lunch I think it might make sense to either say we are going to x place at 1 pm or say you have R150 to spend and we are going to meet outside at 1 pm, but I think it should be clear how much each person can spend, and where they can go, if some people want to go somewhere and others want to go somewhere else splitting up is possible but awkward and it's hot outside. In hindsight I'd probably ask people to vote on like a meal pizza, burgers, whatever and get them delivered and eat at innovation city. Walking around with 5 people was hard. 

There should be a keychain people can use to get in and out the building over the period of the hackathon. 

I think doing the hackathon downstairs on a long table with beanbags would make sense, people often just want to chill and sit next to each other and the current desk isn't very conducive to that. 

Overall the event and vibes got better and better as the time went on. There were some moments where things didn't feel great and people were kind of having arguments or doing stuff that in my opinion made the space uncomfortable. It would be good to have a list of behaviors that are okay to do in the space at the hackathon and a list of things that are explicitly not allowed. And also I think it should be clear to the host that if they're feeling uncomfortable then other people are also and that it's their job to intervene. It took me a couple of minutes before I realized during an argument that it's no one else's job but me to deal with it and it would be good to make that explicit what you are not allowed to do (e.g if someone is harassing someone you're not allowed to kick them out, you _have_ to kick them out) No one harassed anyone but I think it's important to say not what you can do as a host but what you have to do. I think fighting and bad vibes also fall into this category.
