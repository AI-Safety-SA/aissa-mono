                Our research lab is currently studying LLMs' potential impact on human agency, both
                positively and negatively. Our lab is guided by Apart Labs, and we have research
                mentors at top AI labs and universities, such as the Stanford AI Lab and New York
                University. We have also assisted with community-led research projects from our
                fellowship participants, which include overviews on AI Alignments and various
                studies on AI preparedness in Africa.

                We run AI Safety Fundamentals (AISF) fellowships, where we run participants through
                an internationally recognized curriculum. This consists of a set of readings and
                exercises, alongside a reading group led by one of our facilitators.

                We run workshops at top national conferences, such as the Deep Learning IndabaX, and
                SACAIR. These interactive sessions are aimed at engaging ML researchers in the
                fundamentals of AI Safety and communicating the most promising areas of research in
                this quickly evolving field.

                We regularly host meetups in Cape Town, where our community converges to discuss AI
                Safety, and generally hang out and socialize. These we normally host at some of the
                beautiful locations in Cape Town, and are highly engaging community-building events.
